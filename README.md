Work folder

This folder is an attempt to avoid syncing changed files into the mail drafts everyday 
between the work computer and the home machine 

If successful, the process of file syncing could be automated and file structure could be replicated
with little effort.
Also, it would have the addl benefit of providing an online backup.

However, the safety of information could be a concern.
